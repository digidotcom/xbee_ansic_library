    @file xbee/ble.h

    Because this framework dispatches received frames to frame handlers, this
    API layer for BLE makes use of callbacks to pass advertisement responses
    back to the calling code.

    Calling code uses xbee_ble_scan_request() to initiate a scan. The caller
    is expected to have receive handlers in the xbee_frame_handlers[] that
    can handle the frame responses. See below for the callback descriptions
    and definitions.

    For use with the XBee BLU.
