Digi XBee ANSI C Library
========================

The project is a collection of portable ANSI C code for communicating with
Digi International's [XBee] wireless radio modules in API mode. You will
typically compile/link the files directly into your application, instead
of compiling them into a shared/dynamic-link library.  Because of this
design, most of the library configuration takes place at compile time.

This source has been contributed by [Digi International] under the Mozilla
Public License v2.0.  It is a BETA quality software release, and has gone
through a limited QA cycle.

It currently supports the following platforms:

- POSIX operating systems (Windows with [Cygwin] or [MSYS2], Mac OS X, Linux,
  BSD) with gcc
- Windows with [MinGW] or [Mingw-w64] and gcc
- Digi International embedded hardware platforms that use [libdigiapix] to
  control GPIO pins
- DOS using the [OpenWatcom] compiler
- Rabbit-brand microprocessors (using [Dynamic C] 10.70 or later)
- Freescale HCS08 with CodeWarrior 10.x (part of [Programmable XBee Dev Kit])
- Freescale FRDM-KL25Z with [mbed.org] compiler (limited support at this time)
- [Silicon Labs] SLSTK3701A Starter Kit with Gecko SDK Suite v1.1.1 or later
  with optional Micrium OS support

It provides an API for a host platform that communicates with an XBee radio
serially.  Some of the features include:

- Frame dispatcher that passes complete frames from the XBee radio out to
  multiple functions based on frame type.
- Interface for sending API frames serially, with automatic header and
  checksum.
- Message delivery that includes addressing information (short/long remote
  address, source/destination endpoint, cluster ID and profile ID).
- Respond to messages using addressing information from the envelope of
  a received message.
- Interface for sending "AT Command" frames.
- Perform Node Discovery and manage a list of nodes.
- Install firmware images (.EBL/.GBL or .OEM files) on the XBee radio.
- Parse and display digital/analog I/O samples.
- Interface with the General Purpose Memory (GPM) found on some XBee modules.

Requirements
------------
Look at the `README.md` file in the appropriate `ports/` sub-directory
for information on setting up the build environment.


Documentation
-------------
You can find [official documentation] on the GitHub page for the 
project.  To generate local documentation to the `doc/html` directory,
first download and install [Doxygen].

Launch Doxywizard and open `Doxyfile` at the root directory of the driver.
Go to the "Run" tab and click the "Run doxygen" button to build the HTML
documentation files.  The doxygen output will produce warnings for undocumented
portions of the code -- that's OK and expected.

To view the documentation, open `doc/html/index.html` in a web browser.

XBee Firmware
-------------
Configure your XBee radio with DigiMesh, ZigBee or Smart Energy firmware in
"API" mode (with an API mode firmware or by setting ATAP=1).  The samples use
a default baud rate of 115200. The library is written to make use of flow control,
so ATD6/ATD7 needs to be set to 1. Configure the radio with ATAO set to 1 to use
extended transmit and receive frames.


ZigBee Firmware
---------------
When using ZigBee and Smart Energy firmware, keep the radio set to ATAO=1.
In your application, you will need to set AO to 3 at startup in order to
receive and process ZDO/ZDP requests used to discover your device's endpoints
and clusters.  On exit, set AO back to 1 so the radio will process those
requests (and Smart Energy devices can complete Key Establishment to join a
network).

    xbee_cmd_simple(&my_xbee, "AO", 3);

On ZigBee networks without Key Establishment, it should be safe to keep AO set
to 3.

Adding to the Library
=====================

We welcome your contributions to this library of code, but ask that you
please follow these general guidelines.

Coding Style
------------
-	In general, code additions should match the style of existing code.  Old
	files used 3-space tabs to match a legacy codebase, but current preference
	is to use four spaces for indentation instead of tabs.

-	When naming things in the global namespace (functions, macros, global
    variables) use a consistent prefix in the names.

-	Limit line length to 80 characters.

-	Use Doxygen-formatted comments for functions, types, globals and macros.

-	Always use curly braces ({ and }) after if and else statements.  Follow
    style of existing files:

        // Legacy style:
        if (foo)
        {
           do_bar();
        }
        else
        {
           do_baz();
        }

        // Preferred style for new code:
        if (foo) {
            do_bar();
        } else {
            do_baz();
        }

-	Declare pointers as `char *foo`, not `char* foo` or `char * foo`.


Portability
-----------
This driver has been designed for portability to multiple platforms, from a
resource-constrained 8-bit Freescale, up to a Windows PC.  As such, it's
important to keep the following in mind while working with the driver:

-	Leave BeginHeader/EndHeader comments in place -- they're used by the
    linker in Dynamic C on the Rabbit platform.

-	Use ANSI C (C89/C90 preferred, C99 features allowed if widely supported).
    To ease portability, code should not make use of GNU or other compiler
    extensions.

    Exceptions: Some pointers in the driver are labelled `FAR` to allow for
    use of far memory on the Rabbit and HCS08 targets.  Most target platforms
    define `FAR` as an empty macro.

-	Use types from `stdint.h` instead of `int`, `short` and `long`.  Unless
    a variable is used within a function for a loop (where `int` is fine),
    or used in a platform-specific file (e.g., as part of the hardware
    abstraction layer), you should make use of the standard types from
    `stdint.h`: `int8_t`, `uint8_t`, `int16_t`, `uint16_t`, `int32_t`,
    `uint32_t`.

-	Variables and struct members that are stored in non-host-byte-order should
    have `_le` or `_be` appended to their names (for big endian and little
    endian).  Use the functions from `xbee/byteorder.h` (`htobe16`, `le32toh`,
    `memcpy_htobe`, `memcpy_betole`, etc.) to convert between host and
    big/little endian byte order.  If you pretend that you don't know your
    host platform's endian-ness, you'll be forced to write portable code that
    never assumes a given byte order.

    *DO NOT* use `hton`, `ntoh`, `htons`, `ntohs`, `intel` or `intel16`.

    XBee frames store multi-byte values in big endian byte order.
    ZigBee frames store multi-byte values in little endian byte order.
    Target platforms can be big endian or little endian.

    Use `#if BYTE_ORDER == LITTLE_ENDIAN` or `#if BYTE_ORDER == BIG_ENDIAN`
    when code requires different execution paths depending on the target's
    byte order.

-   When working with ZCL attributes, make use of the ZCL types for 40-bit
    `zcl40_t`, 48-bit `zcl48_t`, and 64-bit `zcl64_t` values.  24-bit
    attributes should use `uint32_t` or `int32_t` and 56-bit attributes
    should use `zcl64_t` (ZCL automatically sign extends into the high byte).

-	Place code at the correct layer of the driver.  We're trying to keep the
    ZigBee layers (and above) separate from the XBee layers to allow for possible
    gateway applications (ZigBee to Ethernet, for example), and to limit the
    public release of ZigBee and Smart Energy code.
